     ~12Farmers and Kings ~9is a part BBS and part Role-playing game.  You must
compete with other players as well as the king and his cruel soldiers.  The
object of the game is to kill the king before anyone else does.  You may
talk to many characters around the world to get clues about how to get to
the king's castle then you are on your own. 
     The Land of Trimmail has seven towns.  The capitol town, Trimmail, is
where the castle sits.  You start playing in a small island town where
farming is the main income.  If the game is unregistered, you will not be
able to leave the town, but you will be able to understand how the game
works by just looking around.  If you like the game and would like to see
the rest of the land, help your sysop to register.

~15Characters~12:~9  The characters of the land can usually be found in taverns and
inns.  Some don't like to talk much and will say very little.  Others will
carry on a long conversation.  You type a word symbolizing the question you
would like to ask them.  For example:  if you would like to ask for someone's
name, you would type "name".  You must type out the entire word and can't add
any letters after it.  Remember:  On all characters, typeing ~15bye~9 will get
you out of conversation with them.

~15Weapons~12:~9  You must have a weapon to live.  Therefore, you will always have a
dagger which is the weapon you start with.  Noone will buy a dagger from
you.  You can't own two other weapons at the same time.
        Short-range:  The short-range weapons are your most important.  Try
        to get the best weapon you can.  
        
        Long-range:  Long-range weapons can inflict much more damage than
        short-range but are much harder to aim.  When you first start your
        fight, you can shoot your long-range weapon at your opponent.  If
        you opponent has a long-range weapon, though, he can shoot it at
        you, too.

~15Armour~12:~9  ("Armour" is the british spelling for armor)  There is an important
reason to have armour.  That reason you must figure out for yourself.  
Besides that, armour helps lessen the effects of attacks from your enemy.

~15Player attributes~12:~9  Strength, Dexterity, Aim, and Hit points are 
representations of your physical ability.  Trainers can help you to increase
your abilities in each area but for a price.  Skill levels represent your
experience in combat.  In order to increase your attributes, you must first
increase your skill level.

~15Food~12:~9  To stay alive, you must eat.  The best way to eat is to go fishing and
eat the fish in the fields.  You can go to the farms and slaughter some
cows for meat, or if you are not feeling patient, you can go straight to the
market and buy some food.  Another thing you can do with food is sell it.
You don't need to eat meat all day to stay alive so if you slaughter some
cows, you may go to the market and sell it for money.

~15Skins~12: ~9 If the game is registered, you may sell skins to make money.  You
cut skins from animals you kill in the forest or mountains.  The skins can
be sold for much money.

~15Moving~12:  ~9There are two ways to move from town to town.  The first way you
will have to use is the docks.  Go there and if the game is registered, the
sailor will take you anywhere you would like to go.  The other way is buying
a horse from the stables and then moving from the stables to any town on the
mainland.  Don't worry, you will take your horse with you if you move by the
docks.

~15Guild~12:~9  Once you start playing, you automatically become a member of the Guild.
There are many options to take advantage of in the guild.
        List players:  This will list all players and their locations.

        Read Logbook:  The logbook keeps track of all the events that happen
        during the game.  

        Write Logbook:  If you have a message you would like to give to
        everyone, just write it in the logbook and anyone who reads it,
        which should be a daily action, will see your message.

        Handle personal log:  This is where everyone writes messages to you
        and how to know what happened to you overnight.  You can also write
        notes to yourself in it if there is something you would like to
        remember.

~15Monsters~12:~9  Monsters from presidents to dragons roam the land.  Your location
will determine what kind of monsters are available to fight.  Every town has
either a forest or mountains.  Some monsters will carry money that you can
take after defeating them and some will give you a fine skin to cut off.

~15Battle scene~12:~9  When fighting other players or monsters, there is a common
battle scene with four options:
     Attack:  To lunge forward and strike at your opponent with whatever you
        are carrying.  Your enemy will strike at you either before or after
        you strike them.  A message about the attack will be displayed
        above the command bar, the info about your strike is on bottom and
        the info about the monster's strike is on top.
     Defend:  This is when you kneel down and hide your entire body behind
        your shield (or your arms if you do not carry a shield).  There is
        a specific advantage to doing this which you must figure out for
        yourself.  When you are defending, your enemy rarely misses.
     Run:  Reckless abandon of battle.  This is when you drop your guard, 
        turn around, and run for your life.
     Stats:  To display complete status of your player.  The battle scene
        will give partial status.
     Redraw:  If line noise clutters up the battle scene, this will redraw
        the scene.
Note:  If you do not have ANSI enabled, the battle scene will be scrambled
   and unreadable.  Choose ~15Quick Fight~9 mode from the hunting menu to correct
   this.

~15Farms~12: ~9 You are a desperate adventurer with no home.  Why not fracture a
   small law that will probably be overlooked anyway?  Well, this is your
   chance.  The farms have a nice farmhouse that usually has money hidden
   away somewhere.  If you want meat to feed yourself or to bring some money
   from the market area, you can slaughter some of the cows.  If you can
   manage to succeed in doing one of these, this is the most profitable way
   to get money.  Note:  That is only in this game and not in real life.

~15Getting started~12:~9  If you would like a little help in getting started, read
   this section.  It tells some of the tips to making a living.

   Your very first move in playing the game should be to check out the
tavern.  As in every tavern of the realm, there should be some friendly bar
patrons just sitting around.  The bartender usually has some helpful advice,
too.  Then there is the innkeeper who really can do nothing but say some
non-helpful things.  By now, you should be pretty much decided on what you
need to do after Hayward.  But don't get impatient and try to cross the seas
yet.  Go to the market and talk to the merchant and go to the weapon shop to
talk to the weaponsmith.  They can give you some helpful advice and tips
about the game.  Now it's time to spend some turns!  Go to the beach and try
your luck with fishing.  If you catch some fish, you can sell them to the
market for a few coins.  Now go to the Training hall and go ahead and pay
the ten coins just to talk to the trainer.  If you have enough coins, get
some training by sparring with him.  It may be a good idea to remember
what he said by writing it in your personal log in the guild.  Your personal
log should be used as a diary.  Clear it only when it gets too long or when
you have already carried out anything you had written in it.  If you did  
get your training, go to the forest and fight some animals.  
   In the Hayward Forest, any of the Red animals, especially the squirrel, 
would be easy prey for you.  During battle, if your hit points fall below 5, 
then it would be a good idea to run.  Spend your next bit of cash on armour 
and then get a better weapon.  When you are equiped with at least a Morning 
Star and at least leather armour, and preferrably your strength and dexterity 
to be at least 4, it is time to leave town.  There is something better 
waiting for you somewhere.  If you need some hit points refreshed, try the
healing well or the ale in the pubs.
~15TIP~12:~9  The easiest monsters besides the ones in Hayward are in The Den.
   The Den is a fun place to visit anyway.  You can visit Trimmail, Sussenex,
   or Pomdirgunua before, but the monsters in these towns are much more
   diffucult then those you would have been used to.
~15TIP~12:~9  After increasing skills in The Den, the next place to go is Pomdirgunua,
   it is time to track down the king.
~15TIP~12:~9  The Axe may seem extremely strong, but is not nearly the strongest
   weapon in the game.  Talk to people in Hayward to find the trail of some
   powerful weapons.  One of which is twice as strong as the Axe.  However,
   that weapon, only one player may weild and the only way to get it from
   him is to steal it.
~15TIP~12:~9  Hayward is boring and but a small part of the entire land of Trimmail.
   Help your sysop to register if the game is not already registered.

Good luck in your journeys!  Kill the King!
