following the story is fun, but not necessary to win.

~15Read on for helpful tips.



~15TIP~12:~9  The easiest monsters besides the ones in Hayward are in The Den.
   The Den is a fun place to visit anyway.  You can visit Trimmail, Sussenex,
   or Pomdirgunua before, but the monsters in these towns are much more
   diffucult then those you would have been used to.
~15TIP~12:~9  After increasing skills in The Den, the next place to go is Pomdirgunua,
   it is time to track down the king.
~15TIP~12:~9  The Axe may seem extremely strong, but is not nearly the strongest
   weapon in the game.  Talk to people in Hayward to find the trail of some
   powerful weapons.  One of which is twice as strong as the Axe.  However,
   that weapon, only one player may weild and the only way to get it from
   him is to steal it.
~15TIP~12:~9  Hayward is boring and but a small part of the entire land of Trimmail.
   Help your sysop to register if the game is not already registered.

~6    That should do it!  Good luck.
