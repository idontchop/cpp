Farmers and Kings 2.02 was released in the early '90s and is a fully functional BBS door game written using Turbo C and the Opendoors BBS libraries.
I actually sold this game before I was 16, but with the adaptation of the Internet around that time, BBS systems declined in usage and I no longer had a customer base.
