Farmers and Kings 2.02 was released in the early '90s and is a fully functional BBS door game written using Turbo C and the Opendoors BBS libraries.
I actually sold this game before I was 16, but with the adaptation of the Internet around that time, BBS systems declined in usage and I no longer had a customer base.

It was a sophisticated door game, especially for a teenaged programmer with only a book on C to guide him. This release even had addons, which were not a common feature of any games at the time, much less door games.
