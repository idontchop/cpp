     In your search of the mountains above  Trimmail, you come upon a
     small cave in the side of the mountain just above the tree-line.
     With what little ability to detect magic you have, you can sense
     a large amount of mystical energy radiating from the depths...
             Do you enter the cave?
                                          Yes or No
