   You wake up in your nice country farmhouse on the island of Hayward.  Sounds
of men running through your house echo throughout your room. Suddenly, the door
bursts open and three uniformed soldiers rush in.  You are dragged out by your
hair.  Although you fight and yell, you cannot break free nor does anyone come
to your aid.  After being severly beat, they finally let go.
   Feeling a burning heat, you raise your head to see your poor farmhouse
engulfed in flames.  Then you get a look at the soldiers, you notice them to be
royal guards of the Castle Trimmail.  They climb aboard a horse and cart and
ride towards town.
   After the fire has burned out, you lift yourself up and search through the
charred remains of your once humble home.  All you can pick out is a nice
~15fighting dagger~9, forty gold coins, and a meat knife.  Outside lying beside
the shed is your completely ~15unharmed fishing pole~9.  Your neighbor walks up to
you and throws a backpack on the ground beside you.  He then hurridly rushes
away.  Searching through the pack, you find two loafs of bread.  Quickly, you
stuff all your equipment into the backpack and walk in the direction the
soldiers went.
