    As you approach the forest, an armoured man on a horse races out of the
shadows.  You draw your weapon as the horseman slows to a trot and heads towards
you.  "Lay down your weapon, I am not a threat."  he says.  You hesitate, but
decide to go ahead.  You sheath your weapon but leave it unstrapped.

    "I have come from a dreadful battle.  I group of savages ambushed me.  I
managed to slay them all, but on the way out a Red Squirrel fell from the trees
above and managed to rip blood from my neck.  I barely esacaped the vicious
beast's hold.  If you can kill the beast, I would be grateful."

    "I believe you are new here.  Be careful in that forest.  If your hit points
fall below 5, RUN!  The ale in the tavern can be mighty refreshing.  If you are
looking for money out of the forest, only fight people.  There is a healing well
in the forest, but I can usually only find it once a day."

    "Something very important:  if your strength and dexterity are 1 and you are
facing an opponent with values of 3 or more, you are outmatched.  Do not fight
something that will rip your arms off."

         "Be careful, and don't be too brave to run."
         
The horseman goes on his way.  You continue on to the forest.
