[8C[37mThis large island is home to a small and mildly violent forest.  The
rest of the island is covered with farms, for the rich dirt makes it easy to
grow all kinds of crops.  The Market Place is known for having cheap prices
and the tavern is poor but comfortable.

[31mTrimmail[34m:
[8C[37mThe glorious Trimmail sits in the heart of the land named for itself.
The Castle dominates the middle of town and the rich and marvelous mansions
lie in the west side while the middle class normal citizens dwell in the east
side.  Prices on both sides of town are extremely high.  Both sides of the
city is like a town in itself.  Taverns, Inns, Markets, Weapon shops, Armour
shops, Fur shops, and Trainers can be found on both sides although neither
side is in anyway like the other.  The king's officials have office in the
west side.

[8C[37mLargest in size next to only Trimmail, this town is home to the camp
where the royal soldiers of Trimmail are trained.  If that wasn't enough, the
town is a battleground.  An Arena and the Tyrial Training Acedemy make all
the hearts of the people cold and cruel.  A man would rather challenge you
to fight in the arena than sit and have a drink.  The tavern is more like a
place to look for a fight than to stuff yourself with food.  The town has its
good points though, nowhere else in the country can a collection of better
trainers be found.  Most of the citizens, though violent, are honorable.
They hardly ever fight anywhere but the arena, for it is considered
dishonorable to not fight fairly.  The town also has access to mountains.

[8C[37mThis is the town of peace.  There is a library and university where
a wealth of knowledge can be had.  The scenery here is wonderful and the east
forest lines the east side of town.  The forest is an intermediate fighting
ground.  The prices here are also relatively cheap.

[31mThe Den[34m:
[8C[37mThe infamous pirate gang that calls themselves the wolfs turned this
once beautiful seaside town into a gambling, corrupted hellhole.  If you are
without a spouse and would like some quick fun, the baths boast "clean"
entertainment.  The prices are extreme in the casino and baths as well as
everything else in town.  If you are looking to be a pirate, check out the
tavern.  Everyone knows some wolf is always drinking there.

[8C[37mThis Artisen's town is home to the renowned weapon crafter Scorion.
Across the land, he is known for his skill in creating axes.  But that is not
the only reason this town is well-known, many artists make there home here
and for that reason, the town is extremely extravagent.  Travelers come here
to stay in the luxurious inn.  The tavern is the nicest in the land.  The
city sits on the sea and behind the town rises the highest mountains in the
world.  If you are powerful enough to hunt in here, you can get rich fast.

[8C[37mThe Deep Forest is home to one and only one town.  Only the toughest
and bravest people can survive here.  It really says something to the rest
of the people in Trimmail when this town is also the smallest.  It gets few
travelers.  Stories of dragons keep most people away.  For the Dragon's Den
sits somewhere in the deep forest.  It isn't hard to find but once you find
it, it's hard to get away from.  The forest and the den is the most advanced
fighting area known.  If you want to test yourself, here is the place to go.
