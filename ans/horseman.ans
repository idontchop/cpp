[?7h[40m[2J[4C[0;1;31mAs you approach the forest, an armoured man on a horse races out of the
shadows.  You draw your weapon as the horseman slows to a trot and heads towards[3;1Hyou.  [34m"Lay down your weapon, I am not a threat."  [31mhe says.  You hesitate, but
decide to go ahead.  You sheath your weapon but leave it unstrapped.

    [34m"I have come from a dreadful battle.  A group of savages ambushed me.  I
managed to slay them all, but on the way out a Red Squirrel fell from the trees
above and managed to rip blood from my neck.  I barely esacaped the vicious
beast's hold.  If you can kill the beast, I would be grateful."

    "I believe you are new here.  Be careful in that forest.  If your hit points[12;1Hfall below 5, RUN!  The ale in the tavern can be mighty refreshing.  If you are
looking for money out of the forest, only fight people.  There is a healing well[14;1Hin the forest, but I can usually only find it once a day."

    "Something very important:  if your strength and dexterity are 1 and you are[17;1Hfacing an opponent with values of 3 or more, you are outmatched.  Do not fight
something that will rip your arms off.  If you have money, go get training."

[9C"Be careful, and don't be too brave to run."

[31mThe horseman goes on his way.  You continue on to the forest.[0m[255D
