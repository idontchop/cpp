WARNING!!!  Whether or not this will work right is still kinda ify.
You should get in touch with me before writing one or wait for a higher
version.


Using the 3rdparty.exe file, it is simple to add a module to this game to 
be reached by way of searching the forest.  
If you are inclined in programming doors and would like to program and module
sysops can add to this game, read on.  Otherwise, this file contains nothing.
-------------------------------------------
3rdparty.exe
-------------------------------------------

First in order to let FK know there is a 3rdparty module installed, you must
use 3rdparty.exe.  It is a simple program that uses 3rdparty.dat file to
store all modules.  To use 3rdparty.exe, enter these parameters in your
install program:

3rdparty [module name] [town location] [path/file to mod] [path to fk]

EXP:
3rdparty "Wishing well" hayward c:\fk\wish\wish.exe c:\fk

You will need to write an install program to find out where Farmers and Kings
is located and perhaps to find out what town the sysop would prefer your
module to be located in.  The name of the module can be up to 70 characters
long.  If you need to put a space in the name, use quotation marks.
Towns should be specified by the following:
        Hayward
        Den
        Pomdirgunua
        Burkshire

These are the only towns that have forests.  Please try to keep your type
of modules correct on the town.  As in, don't put a Pirate's Treasure Hole
in Pomdirgunua, or a carnival in Burkshire.
As to the size and and extent of your module, it doesn't matter to me at all.
You can program a whole game and add it on if you want to.
FK does swap itself to EMS or disk, but does not exit completely.

-----------------------------------------
FKDROP.DAT
-----------------------------------------

When a 3rdparty module is spawned from Farmers and Kings, a drop file is
created in the directory called fkdrop.dat.  It contains the following
information:
* - can be edited by module

User's Alias *
User's Sex * M or F
User's strength *  1-22
User's dexterity * 1-22
User's aim * 1-20
User's experience * 1-60000
User's current hit points * 1- totalhit
User's total possible hit points * 1-220
User's coins * 1-60000
User's ammo * 1-40
User's long-range weapon
User's short-range weapon
Path to BBS drop file

*IMPORTANT:  Fkdrop.dat must be written back or not deleted.  First ten 
values must be available to be read by Farmers and Kings.
Failare to do so could crash the game.

Long-range weapon and short-range weapon will contain the following values:

        Short-range
        -----------
1- Dagger
2- Short Sword
3- Mace
5- Morning Star
6- Long Sword
7- Axe
9- White Sword

30- Sling

-------------------------------
LOCAL PLAY
-------------------------------

        If Farmers and Kings is being played in local mode, it will pass a
command-line parameter to your program of "l"  Use this to run your program
in local mode.

Finally

        Well, that should get you started.  Feel free to read player.dat, for
more information but please do not edit it in anyway.  If you would like to
know more about how Farmers and Kings works or would like to know exactly
how all variables are stored in Player.dat, feel free to call my bulletin
board and ask.  If you program a module, I would love to see it, upload
it to my bulletin board.  And if it is OK, I would like to see the source
code.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at my Bulletin
Board:
