Programmed with Opendoors Door Programming Toolkit v5.1 beta

I would like to thank DALE DEWOODY and ALAN THIESSAN for their ideas and
the ANSI screens of Sussenex and Burkshire.

I would also like to thank these people for playtesting.  (Whether they knew
thats what they were doing or not):

Farmers and Kings was written using Turbo C++ and Opendoors Door Programming
Toolkit.  FK supports RemoteAccess, QuickBBS, PC-Board, Maximus, Opus,
Wildcat!, WWIV, Spitfire, SuperBBS, Telegard, RBBS-PC, TriTel, GAP, and
others.

Fk supports any boards with the following dropfiles:  CHAIN.TXT, 
       DORINFO1.DEF, EXITINFO.BBS, DOOR.SYS, SFDOORS.DAT, CALLINFO.BBS

Even though I have spent months and months testing this game, and I'm
sure it is safe, I will not hold any responsibility for damage done by 
use of this game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now on to INSTALLATION!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FK172.ZIP should have contained the following files:
     Install.exe        -       Used to setup game
     King.exe           -       Main playing file
     fkedit.exe         -       Player and settings editor
     Maintain.exe       -       Runs maintenance
     3rdparty.exe       -       Used to add game modules

     Fksysop.doc        -       This file: explains everything
     3rdparty.doc       -       Explains use of 3rdparty.exe
     chat.doc           -       Explains use of external chat

     Order.frm          -       To send in for registration

     20 *.ANS files
     12 *.DAT files
      8 *.ASC files

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Setup
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The first step in setting up the game is running INSTALL.EXE. 
It will set up a single node for use with fk.bat.  For multi-node 
systems, use fkedit.exe to setup all other nodes.
The reason for this batch file is to change the directory to where
Farmers and Kings is located.  Now the game is ready to play locally.
Run king.exe with the command-line parameter of -l.

FK.BAT must receive the node number as a parameter.

IMPORTANT:
     You may want to check fk.bat out and make sure it fits your board's
needs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Run it local
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

KING /L

     The game should work perfectly.  Take time to look through the game
and see whether or not this game is worthy for your BBS.  If the game is
unregistered, notice how you cannot move to another town from the docks.  
This is the only way the game is crippled while not registered.  But 80
percent of the game is across the seas.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Setup for BBS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
FK [nodenumber]     

     Run fk.bat from the BBS.  Or if your BBS uses its own batch files to 
run doors, feel free to bypass fk.bat and run king.exe directly.  But be 
sure to run king.exe with the node number as a parameter.

EXP (for single node systems using fk.bat)
        fk 1

EXP (for single node systems bypassing fk.bat)
        cd\fk
        king 1
        
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.   DON'T FORGET THIS STEP:   Maintenance
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        I made MAINTAIN.EXE a seperate file so that the sysop could run
it anytime preferred.  Also so that playing the game locally would not
be such a hassle.  Just run the file from your nightly batch file or
whenever you prefer to do it.

HOWEVER:  You must change the directory to where FK is located.  Sorry
for the trouble.
EXP:

C:
CD\FK
MAINTAIN

     DO NOT run maintain.exe just before king.exe unless you want to start a
new playing day everytime someone plays.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
fkedit.exe
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's all you need.  You can use fkedit.exe to configure the game to your
preferences.  FKedit is a simple, quick program to edit players, change 
settings, setup nodes, or to register the game.  

If you run a multi-node system, be sure to setup your nodes!

Well, That's it!  The game is ready to be played.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
REGISTRATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Before the game is registered, it is completely playable.  However it
does have an annoying feature which limits the fun in the game.  The Land
of Trimmail is made of seven towns each with its own ANSI file.  The player
starts on a small island.  The annoying feature is that the player cannot 
move to another town using the docks.  That makes the game unwinnable and
very boring compared to all the game has to offer.  There is no limitation
for the sysop unless he is a player.

     To register, print out the file order.frm and fill it out.  Or if you
do not have a printer, you can write out all the information.
Send the form plus $14 to this address:

                Jeb Dunn
                POB 1805
                Ft. Gibson, OK  74434
                USA

     The $14 must be payed in US currency by cash, check, or money order.
I am not responsible for any cash lost in the mail.  But I have never lost
any cash in the mail and that is usually the way I send in registrations.

READ THE BOTTOM OF THIS FILE FOR IMPORTANT NOTICE!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYSOP FUNCTION KEYS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     There is a variety of function keys the sysop can use while someone is
playing the game.

F9      Display help information: tells the functions of all the other
        function keys.
[UP]/[DOWN]     To increase or decrease amount of time left for user.
ALT-C   To break in for a chat with user, [ESC] will end chat
ALT-J   Allows you to shell to DOS.
ALT-H   To Hang up on the user.  Will return control to BBS.
ALT-L   (Works with some info files) Hangs up on user and locks them out of
        BBS.
ALT-D   Drops user to BBS.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If there is any question you want to ask, I will try to answer them in
this section.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     FK does monitor carrier and checks for inactivity.  It does not check
for vulgar words used as handles but the user can be deleted or the handle
changed by using FKedit.  The maximum amount of players is 50 (which I am
going to try to change in the next version).  The game is played using turns
as many other games do.  There is no time limit except for the time left on
the BBS.  If the user's time has run out, the game will return control to the
BBS.
     
     When the game is won by a user, noone will be able to play until
maintenance is ran.  So, if someone asks you to restart the game because
someone has beaten it, don't worry about it.  As long as maintain.exe is ran
at midnight, no problem with restarting.  If for some reason you want to
restart the game before it is won, run install.exe.

     Although I tested the game as thoroughly as I could, there are probably
still some stinken bugs hidden somewhere in the game.  If you find one, I
would really appreciate being informed.  I will put your name and BBS number
in the docs of upcoming versions somewhere.  

If you are having trouble with the game for any reason or would like
to comment to me about the game, contact me at:

HISTORY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

First release:  October '94

"Farmers and Kings" originally started as "To Kill a King" but due to 
criticism and the urge for a more game-like name, it was changed.

Version 1 : Started out as "To Kill a King".  This was basically a quick 
            release and completely full of bugs.  In fact on most systems,
            the game was not operatable at all.  

Version 1.05 : ANSI screens were fixed, log-in crashes were fixed.  Several
            misspelled words were fixed.

Version 1.1  : "To Kill a King" changed to "Farmers and Kings."  New ANSI 
            screens.  Instruction file rewritten.  Sysop file rewritten.
            Several unnoticeable bugs in install.exe were fixed.
            Entire game was basically cleaned up.

Version 1.5  : Colors were fixed.  Now low-intensity colors are shown.  Now
            FK can be used with RA 2.00+ and is aware of Windows.  3rdparty
            module support was added.  Easier installation.  A couple new
            ANSI screens.  Several new features added.  New weapon added.
            It is now easier to get started at first.  Fksysop.doc rewritten
            again.  Horseman tip screen added.

Version 1.6  : Multi-node support is added.  All text files such as log files
            are given color.  Bank style treasure hole added.

Version 1.65 : Multi-node bugs worked out.  Quick instructions, tavern
            conversations and many other features added. 

Version 1.7  : More Multi-node bugs worked out.  Bright hotkeys added.
            Sheild conversions added.  Choice of Powerful player or Rich
            player added at beginning.  3rd party module technology update.

Version 1.71 : Minor bug fixes.  FILE_ID.DIZ added to zip.

Version 1.72 : Minor bug fixes, mostly having to do with unavailable commands.

FUTURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Farmers and Kings version 2.0 will be one killer game!  
Plus more multi-node features.  The broken farmer will be
able to become a thief and join the Thieves Guild.  Almost every building
in the game will have an arcade or strategy type way of stealing things.
When a player dies, the option of playing the "other side" is open.  The
Library will come alive as a "mission headquarters."  The library will give
information for all kinds of subplots to be followed up on completely off
the path of the king. 

        When this version comes out, if you haven't already registered
        Farmers and Kings, the registration cost will be $15 to $25 dollars.
        After it comes out, registration for 1.** will still be $14 but
        to get 2.0, there will be an upgrade charge.  So register now
        to get the upcoming game registration and all later ones for free.

Farmers and Kings version 2.0 is scheduled for release after April '96
and no later than July '96.  

I HOPE YOU ENJOY THE GAME!
