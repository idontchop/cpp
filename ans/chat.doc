Farmers and Kings offers an easy to use, colorful, and interaction-full
teleconference-style chat.  In order for the game to have maximum use on
your board, I have offered a way for up to ten additional users to access
the chat on top of the 50 players that can be in it at a time.

The only thing that needs to be done is adding the arguement "chat" on to
king.exe.  NOTE:  It will do no good adding it to fk.bat.

examples:  

        node 1:
          king 1 chat

        local:
          king local chat

I have left this feature for use unregistered, but please register if you 
use this feature.  Afterall, there are some chat doors out there equal in
quality to this one that have a registering price close to the price for
this whole package.
